        <p>
            <strong>Durring July</strong>, I stayed at home and played games everyday. I also did
            some baking and cooking, trying out some new recipies. My little
            brother's birthday is in July so we celebrated it.

            I like to lay in bed at the end of a long day -- really look foward
            to it actually. I like the weekends because that is when I get
            to chill. I also like to have stream parties with friends on the weekend. 

            I dislike getting up early in the morning and transiting to school. 
            Having bad RNG in games is the absolute <em>worst</em>.
